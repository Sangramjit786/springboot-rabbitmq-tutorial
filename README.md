1) Create and Setup Spring Boot 3 Project in IntelliJ – Connect to RabbitMQ and Configure RabbitMQ Producer:- 
Objective: Initialize a Spring Boot 3 application with RabbitMQ integration to support asynchronous messaging.

Implementation Steps:

Spring Boot Initialization:
Used Spring Initializr with dependencies:

Spring Web

Spring AMQP

Spring Boot DevTools

Project Setup in IntelliJ IDEA:
Imported as a Maven project and ensured SDK and build settings were configured properly for Java 17+.

RabbitMQ Configuration in application.properties:

spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
spring.rabbitmq.username=guest
spring.rabbitmq.password=guest
Define Exchange, Queue, and Binding:
Configured DirectExchange, Queue, and Binding as Spring @Beans to enable routing.

Create RabbitMQ Producer:
Used RabbitTemplate in a RabbitMQProducer class:


rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(exchange, routingKey, message);
Interview Insight:
Demonstrates foundational understanding of message brokers, Spring AMQP integration, and component-based configuration.

2) Create RabbitMQ Consumer:- 
Objective: Implement a listener to receive messages from a RabbitMQ queue asynchronously.

Implementation Steps:

Created a consumer class using @RabbitListener(queues = "queue_name").

Implemented business logic to process the received string message.

Added logging and basic validation to verify message flow.

Professional Tip:
Showcase understanding of message-driven architecture, decoupling of services, and how RabbitMQ consumers help build scalable systems.

3) Create REST API to Send Message:- 
Objective: Expose an HTTP endpoint to allow external clients to publish messages to RabbitMQ via the producer.

Implementation Steps:

Defined a REST controller with @RestController.

Created a POST endpoint /api/publish that accepts a plain text message.

Injected the RabbitMQProducer and passed the message to it.

Code Snippet:


@PostMapping("/publish")
public ResponseEntity<String> sendMessage(@RequestBody String message) {
    producer.send(message);
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Message sent");
}
Interview Insight:
Highlights synchronous-to-asynchronous handoff, REST abstraction over messaging, and clean separation of concerns.

4) Create RabbitMQ Producer to Produce JSON Message:- 
Objective: Extend the producer to support structured data (JSON) transmission to RabbitMQ.

Implementation Steps:

Defined a POJO (e.g., User, Order).

Serialized the object to JSON using Jackson (auto-configured in Spring Boot).

Published the JSON string using RabbitTemplate.

Example:


rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(exchange, routingKey, objectMapper.writeValueAsString(order));
Best Practice:
Ensures type safety and structured communication—critical in enterprise systems where domain entities are passed between services.

5) Create REST API to Send JSON Object:- 
Objective: Allow external systems to send domain-specific JSON payloads to the producer.

Implementation Steps:

Modified or added a new REST endpoint:


@PostMapping("/publishJson")
public ResponseEntity<String> sendJson(@RequestBody Order order) {
    producer.sendOrder(order);
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Order sent");
}
Validated input using Java Bean Validation annotations (e.g., @NotNull).

Professional Value:
Shows comfort working with REST + JSON + messaging, enabling rich object transmission across services.

6) Create RabbitMQ Consumer to Consume JSON Message:- 
Objective: Deserialize JSON message into domain object and perform business logic.

Implementation Steps:

Used @RabbitListener to receive the message.

Deserialized JSON to POJO using Jackson:


Order order = objectMapper.readValue(message, Order.class);
Implemented business logic like persistence, validation, or further event emission.

Best Practice:
Handled exceptions gracefully and included logging for observability and traceability.

Summary:- 
“I built a Spring Boot 3 application with full RabbitMQ messaging capabilities. I created a REST interface for publishing plain text and JSON messages to a queue and built consumers to handle both. I used POJOs and object mapping to ensure type safety and modularity. The architecture reflects asynchronous decoupling, clean layering, and real-world messaging workflows — all crucial in distributed systems.”
